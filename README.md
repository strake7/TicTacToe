# TicTacToe nXn
2-player local game of 2D tic tac toe on a user-defined nxn grid. Max n-grid size of 15 and minimum of 3  

This project will show you some light PHP and heavy JavaScript usage to create a single page application that is the game of tic-tac-toe. It features two configurable players and a selectable grid size. Currently, the game is in 2D. I chose this concept as it bluntly reflects core web programming concepts while maintaining an innate simplicity that is easy to discuss and expound upon.  

You should be able to spin this project up on any machine running PHP and a web server but do keep in mind that it does have CDN dependencies for knockout and font-awesome. Also, please note, that this project is not a design sample.   

## Dependencies
PHP 5.6.7 +
IE 8+,   
knockout.js 3.0 +   
knockout-validation.js (https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/Knockout-Validation)

  Edited using eclipse
  
## Looking Forward  
3D?
